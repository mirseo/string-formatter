# Mirseo Formatter Performance Analysis Report

**Language**: [Korean (한국어)](performance_analysis.md) | **English**

## Overview

This document presents the performance comparison analysis results between Mirseo Formatter and basic normalization methods. The benchmark measured detection accuracy and processing speed across various attack patterns and normal text.

## Benchmark Design

### Test Dataset

Composed of a total of 46 test cases:
- **Normal Text** (23 cases): General conversations and long text
- **Attack Text** (23 cases): Various types of injection attacks

#### Classification by Attack Type
- **Direct Attacks**: Clear jailbreak attempts
- **Obfuscated Attacks**: Leetspeak, Unicode variations
- **Encoding Attacks**: Malicious patterns encoded in Base64
- **Complex Attacks**: Attacks combining multiple techniques

### Comparison Targets

1. **Mirseo Formatter**: High-performance Rust-based analyzer
2. **Basic Normalization**: Basic pattern matching implemented in Python

## Performance Analysis Results

### Detection Accuracy

| Metric | Mirseo Formatter | Basic Normalization | Improvement |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Accuracy** | 71.7% | 54.4% | **+31.8%** |
| **Precision** | 100.0% | 100.0% | Same |
| **Recall** | 40.9% | 4.5% | **+808%** |
| **F1 Score** | 58.1% | 8.7% | **+568%** |

#### Key Findings
- **Accuracy**: Mirseo Formatter achieved 31.8% higher accuracy
- **Recall**: Significantly lower rate of missing actual attacks
- **Precision**: Both methods had no false positives

### Processing Performance

| Metric | Mirseo Formatter | Basic Normalization | Difference |
|--------|------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Average Processing Time** | 30.1ms | 0.05ms | **600x slower** |
| **Median Processing Time** | 27.1ms | 0.02ms | **1,355x slower** |

#### Performance Trade-offs
- Mirseo Formatter performs more computations (regex compilation, encoding decoding, etc.)
- Processing time increases due to complex detection logic
- However, 30ms is within practical acceptable range

### Performance by Category

#### Direct Attacks
- **Mirseo**: High detection rate
- **Basic Normalization**: Only detects basic patterns

#### Obfuscated Attacks
- **Mirseo**: Excellent detection with advanced normalization techniques
- **Basic Normalization**: Only partially handles simple Leetspeak

#### Base64 Encoding Attacks
- **Mirseo**: Automatic decoding followed by pattern analysis
- **Basic Normalization**: Limited decoding attempts

#### Long Text Processing
- **Mirseo**: Processing time increases proportionally to text length
- **Basic Normalization**: Relatively constant processing time

## Additional Analysis

### Threshold Optimization
Currently using 0.3 as the default threshold, but can be adjusted according to environment:
- **Strict Security**: 0.2 (increased recall, some false positives possible)
- **Balanced Setting**: 0.3 (current default)
- **Conservative Setting**: 0.5 (precision priority, some attacks may be missed)

### Performance Optimization Strategies
1. **Rule Optimization**: Remove unnecessary patterns
2. **Enhanced Caching**: Expand normalization result cache
3. **Parallel Processing**: Utilize multithreading for bulk processing
